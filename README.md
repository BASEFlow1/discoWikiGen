# flWiki
Very WIP dynamic wiki page source generator for Discovery Freelancer 

The idea as of right now is to dump everything I can into one file and using that to build a wiki page later on.

## Dependencies
- [flint](https://github.com/biqqles/flint)
- pyperclip

To install, do:
`pip install fl-flint`
`pip install pyperclip`
