# flWiki
Very WIP dynamic wiki page source generator for Discovery Freelancer 

The idea as of right now is to dump everything I can into one file and using that to build a wiki page later on.

## Dependencies
- My [fork](https://github.com/BASEFlow1/flint) of [flint](https://github.com/biqqles/flint)
- pyperclip
